# Prudential Life Insurance Assessment
Springboard Capstone Project

## The problem to solve.
The online application for life insurance is time consuming and antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.

**Prudential**, one of the largest issuers of life insurance in the USA, wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.  A predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach can help Prudential better understand the assessment process.

The purpose of this project is to predict  the "Response" variable for each Id in the test set. "Response" is an ordinal measure of risk that has 8 levels.

## The Data. 
The Data is provided by Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment/data
- train.cvs: Contains the response values.
- test.csv: The test set, you must predict the Response variable for all rows in this file.
- sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format.

## How to solve the problem.
Tentative approaches are classification techniques such as logistic regression or decision trees to group someone as insurable or not, or a predictive model to calculate their total risk.

## The Deliverables.
1.	Code for the project documented on github.
2.	A final paper explaining the problem, approach and findings 
3.	A slide deck for the project or a blog post for Springboard’s technical blog.
